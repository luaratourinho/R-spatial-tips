# R-spatial-tips

Here, I am providing a set of short R scripts with some basic commands for spatial data.

For example, reading spatial objects such as points, polygons and rasters, projecting them, writing them, and others.

### List of scripts and explanations

* Reprojecting.R

In this routine, you can find how to read polygons and rasters, project them, and write them.
There are also some examples of projection commands (e.g. Albers Equal Area, WGS84...).
